## Introduction

Coqui TTS is a text-to-speech (TTS) library that enables the conversion of regular text into speech. It provides pre-trained models and vocoders as part of its package.

The underlying technology of text-to-speech is highly intricate. However, if you're interested in delving deeper into the subject, here are some recommended talks:

- [Pushing the frontier of neural text to speech](https://youtu.be/MA8PCvmr8B0), a webinar by Xu Tan at Microsoft Research Asia
- [Text to Speech Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLBedWj-5CQ), a talk given during the ML for Audio Study Group hosted by Hugging Face.
